# Steffen Dielmann's Tutotial Project for Unit Tests in Angular

This project can be used as a guidance how to write unit tests in different scenarios in Angular. The project has been written in Angular 11 and is derived from my [boilerplate project](https://github.com/sdielmann/angular-boilerplate) which is also available on github.

## Running the tests

Run `jest` to execute the unit tests via [jest](https://jestjs.io/).
